But when you buy or lease servers from a provider like OVH. Those servers might be sitting half way around the world. So if something goes wrong you need to some how virtually be in front of the keyboard.
OVH has a few different ways to access your servers console to interact with the machine directly.<span class=mldr>&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class=item><a class=note href=/2020/08/28/decision-fatigue-in-2020/><p class="note title">Decision Fatigue in 2020</p><p class="note date">2020-08-28</p><p class="note content">This last couple of weeks I finally took some time off of work to try and reset. Iâ€™m not always the greatest at taking time off. I take an extra day or two combined with the weekend for a mini-vacation around the Holidays to see family and itâ€™s often the minimum time needed. This year with everything going on really had to force my self to step back and try to reset with a staycation.<span class=mldr>&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class=item><a class=note href=/2020/05/01/a-k8s-migration-concept/><p class="note title">A k8s Migration Concept</p><p class="note date">2020-05-01</p><p class="note content">Surprisingly I donâ€™t have a lot of kubernetes related content on my blog yet. This might just because Iâ€™m too busy using it to talk about it. But iâ€™m a heavy user of it. To me it just makes orchestrating work loads easier.
One thing in general I donâ€™t see a lot of talk about is migrating between infrastructure. Especially donâ€™t see much for kubernetes.
So I wanted to share a high level concept set of steps that iâ€™ve followed a couple of times to migrate between a couple of kubernetes clusters with minimal to no downtime.<span class=mldr>&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class=tag href=/tags/100daystooffload/>100DaysToOffload</a></p></li><li class=item><a class=note href=/2020/05/01/quarantainment/><p class="note title">Quarantainment</p><p class="note date">2020-05-01</p><p class="note content">I donâ€™t think its likely a surprise to anyone if I say Iâ€™m typically an introvert. I stay at and around home a lot in general. But when its no longer by choice.. kinda takes the fun out of it.
We identified early on that we needed to keep our selves busy and entertained.
Started out the quarantine with me teaching my wife to play chess.

I&rsquo;d say most people add for completely honest reasoning. They just want to be able to see how their site is doing and if anyone actually shows up.
But its really important to go down the path with caution. If you dont carefully select and think through your analyticsâ€¦ You end up spying on your users likely without even realizing it.<span class=mldr>&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class=tag href=/tags/100daystooffload/>100DaysToOffload</a></p></li><li class=item><a class=note href=/2020/04/28/de-googling-my-progress/><p class="note title">De-Googling: My Progress</p><p class="note date">2020-04-28</p><p class="note content">I wrote a bit about my reasoning to De-Google here.

Search Or Google as many think of it. This one I have toyed with off and on with over the years. But a while back probably around a year ago.. I was listening to a podcast.

Ok that&rsquo;s it I spoiled it! Now you don&rsquo;t need to read on ðŸ˜œ But I&rsquo;ll explain anyways.
Privacy Google gives their applications and services away for free. This is extreeemly attractive!

But I believe hacking is a mindset. It&rsquo;s about trying to be creative.. Taking things and making them work in a different way. It&rsquo;s about not letting your self be your own limiter. Just because you&rsquo;ve never done something beforeâ€¦ doesn&rsquo;t mean you shouldn&rsquo;t try.
I don&rsquo;t consider my self good at carpentry. Or using screws, hammers, power tools etc.. I&rsquo;m also sure some most of the work makes professionals cringe just like I do at code by a novice.<span class=mldr>&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class=tag href=/tags/100daystooffload/>100DaysToOffload</a></p></li><li class=item><a class=note href=/2020/04/25/100-day-writing-challenge/><p class="note title">100 Day writing challenge</p><p class="note date">2020-04-25</p><p class="note content">Hello its me again your friendly neighborhood Geek Gone Crazy.ðŸ˜œ Its been a bit less time since my last post than normal.

The idea being much like 100 days of code it encourages a person to sit down to write more often.
