This announcement is an exciting one to me. I&rsquo;ve been working with Rocket.Chat since I found it almost 7 years ago. One of the things I recall from early on is the vision of being as ubiquitious as email. One of the beauties of email is not everyone is on the same domain or let alone even the same kind of mail server. Just all speaking the same language.<span class=mldr>&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class=item><a class=note href=/2021/07/04/rover-project-update-3/><p class="note title">Rover Project: Update 3</p><p class="note date">2021-07-04</p><p class="note content">Finally a more eventful update!
Last time I worked with building parts in CAD I was using solidworks or AutoCAD. I have no desire to buy either one of those right now plus I need something that will run on linux. So started investing some time into learning my way around FreeCAD.
Creating first iteration of the wheel 50mm radius for a 10cm/100mm diameter wheel
3mm thick
Based on the specs of the motor:<span class=mldr>&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class=tag href=/tags/rover-project/>rover-project</a></p></li><li class=item><a class=note href=/2021/07/04/rover-project-update-2/><p class="note title">Rover Project: Update 2</p><p class="note date">2021-07-04</p><p class="note content">So the robot parts sat in my closet for a few months. I kind of forgot to order the parts.
Recently realized I really need to disconnect more fully from work in my off hours. When your hobby includes coding and in same language as you write for work.. Its a bit harder to keep your brain from making that jump to thinking about work.
So i&rsquo;ve been on the look out for new hobbies.<span class=mldr>&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class=tag href=/tags/rover-project/>rover-project</a></p></li><li class=item><a class=note href=/2021/07/04/rover-project-update-1/><p class="note title">Rover Project: Update 1</p><p class="note date">2021-07-04</p><p class="note content">Parts came in!
Finally got time to work on it again. We wired everything up.
We gathered up some cardboard. We found something to trace and cut out 4 wheels. (you&rsquo;ll notice this is defintely a deviation from the original sketch. But this was insisted on once the additional motors were spotted).
We also put together the transmitter on another breadboard
Now if you do electronics seriously at all you&rsquo;ll probably notice straight away two different issues.<span class=mldr>&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class=tag href=/tags/rover-project/>rover-project</a></p></li><li class=item><a class=note href=/2021/07/04/rover-project/><p class="note title">Rover Project</p><p class="note date">2021-07-04</p><p class="note content">My family is very STEM oriented. I grew up learning hands on at home. Taking things apart. Questioning how things worked and eventually learning how to actually fix those things I took apart. As much as possible we&rsquo;re trying to encourage this for our kids.
They are pretty fortunate as they have good examples of this on both sides of the family. So they come by their curiousity about the world around them very naturally.<span class=mldr>&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class=tag href=/tags/rover-project/>rover-project</a></p></li><li class=item><a class=note href=/2020/09/07/ovh-serial-over-lan-sol/><p class="note title">OVH Serial over LAN (SOL)</p><p class="note date">2020-09-07</p><p class="note content">Its been a while since I&rsquo;ve worked with physical servers and typically when something happened I could pretty quickly get physical access to the box if things went pear shaped.
But when you buy or lease servers from a provider like OVH. Those servers might be sitting half way around the world. So if something goes wrong you need to some how virtually be in front of the keyboard.
OVH has a few different ways to access your servers console to interact with the machine directly.<span class=mldr>&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class=item><a class=note href=/2020/09/07/tinkerbell-or-ipxe-boot-on-ovh/><p class="note title">Tinkerbell or iPXE boot on OVH</p><p class="note date">2020-09-07</p><p class="note content">Recently have had to work with a number of physical servers that need to be treated more cattle like than a bunch of pets. I need to be able to quickly and easily provision servers to fit a specific role with out having to go through a complicated setup process.
For this type of thing PXE or iPXE comes to the rescue. Allowing you to boot over the network. Simply rebooting the machine and then having it pick up its instructions and be provisioned like needed.<span class=mldr>&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class=item><a class=note href=/2020/08/28/decision-fatigue-in-2020/><p class="note title">Decision Fatigue in 2020</p><p class="note date">2020-08-28</p><p class="note content">This last couple of weeks I finally took some time off of work to try and reset. I’m not always the greatest at taking time off. I take an extra day or two combined with the weekend for a mini-vacation around the Holidays to see family and it’s often the minimum time needed. This year with everything going on really had to force my self to step back and try to reset with a staycation.<span class=mldr>&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class=item><a class=note href=/2020/05/01/a-k8s-migration-concept/><p class="note title">A k8s Migration Concept</p><p class="note date">2020-05-01</p><p class="note content">Surprisingly I don’t have a lot of kubernetes related content on my blog yet. This might just because I’m too busy using it to talk about it. But i’m a heavy user of it. To me it just makes orchestrating work loads easier.
One thing in general I don’t see a lot of talk about is migrating between infrastructure. Especially don’t see much for kubernetes.
So I wanted to share a high level concept set of steps that i’ve followed a couple of times to migrate between a couple of kubernetes clusters with minimal to no downtime.<span class=mldr>&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class=tag href=/tags/100daystooffload/>100DaysToOffload</a></p></li><li class=item><a class=note href=/2020/05/01/quarantainment/><p class="note title">Quarantainment</p><p class="note date">2020-05-01</p><p class="note content">I don’t think its likely a surprise to anyone if I say I’m typically an introvert. I stay at and around home a lot in general. But when its no longer by choice.. kinda takes the fun out of it.
We identified early on that we needed to keep our selves busy and entertained.
Started out the quarantine with me teaching my wife to play chess. So pulled out the ‘ol Mario chess set.<span class=mldr>&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class=tag href=/tags/100daystooffload/>100DaysToOffload</a></p></li></ul><div class=pagination><ul><li><a class=active href=/>1</a></li><li><a href=/page/2/>2</a></li><li><a href=/page/3/>3</a></li></ul></div></section><section id=footer><div class=footer-wrap><p class=copyright>Aaron's Ramblings</p><p class=powerby><span>Powered by </span><a href=https://gohugo.io target=_blank>Hugo</a><span> and the </span><a href=https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-notepadium/ target=_blank>Notepadium</a></p></div></section></body></html>
