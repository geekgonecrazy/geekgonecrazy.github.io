In prior years for work I would write an internal post about the year to help us realize all of the things we managed to accomplish that year. I found the research and reflection while writing the post to be very revealing. We some times get so caught up in the daily grind, we aren&rsquo;t able to see what we&rsquo;ve managed to accomplish. This year going to give it a try applying it to my personal life.<span class=mldr>&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class=item><a class=note href=/2023/09/24/fedora-iot-greenboot-systemd-and-of-course-dns/><p class="note title">Fedora Iot, Greenboot, Systemd and of course DNS</p><p class="note date">2023-09-24</p><p class="note content">This post is mostly as a resource for future me. But maybe it&rsquo;ll come in useful to someone else.
This weekend I was working on provisioning a new NAS/Media box setup after having to do a bit of hardware shuffling. Long story.
I decided to try Fedora iot on a whim. Fedora iot has an interesting project called greenboot. The objective of the project is to define some checks for the state of the machine.<span class=mldr>&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class=tag href=/tags/fedora/>fedora</a><a class=tag href=/tags/systemd/>systemd</a><a class=tag href=/tags/dns/>dns</a></p></li><li class=item><a class=note href=/2023/05/23/how-to-set-up-client-ssl-certificate-authentication-for-rocket%2echat/><p class="note title">How to Set Up Client SSL Certificate Authentication for Rocket.Chat</p><p class="note date">2023-05-23</p><p class="note content">Are you looking to add an extra layer of security to access Rocket.Chat? One way to do this is by implementing client SSL certificate authentication. This authentication method requires clients to present a valid SSL certificate to authenticate themselves to the server.
In this post, we will walk through the steps to set up client SSL certificate authentication using Nginx.
Prerequisites A server running Ubuntu Allow HTTP/HTTPS/ssh in security group Create a public IP and associate it.<span class=mldr>&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class=item><a class=note href=/2022/06/16/adventures-of-the-geek-remote-password-reset/><p class="note title">Adventures of the Geek: Remote Password Reset</p><p class="note date">2022-06-16</p><p class="note content">Our adventure begins on a Monday evening. I received a call from a family member that lives a bit over 8 hours away.
I powered on my laptop today and it won&rsquo;t take my password
Unfortunately the laptop runs Windows 10. I have made it a point to not use windows and haven&rsquo;t for last several years. Primarily using linux or osx. Leaving me at a bit of a disadvantage.<span class=mldr>&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class=item><a class=note href=/2022/05/30/rocketchat-and-the-matrix-protocol/><p class="note title">Rocket.Chat and the Matrix Protocol</p><p class="note date">2022-05-30</p><p class="note content">Rocket.Chat now has federation support via the Matrix protocol.
This announcement is an exciting one to me. I&rsquo;ve been working with Rocket.Chat since I found it almost 7 years ago. One of the things I recall from early on is the vision of being as ubiquitious as email. One of the beauties of email is not everyone is on the same domain or let alone even the same kind of mail server.<span class=mldr>&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class=item><a class=note href=/2021/07/04/rover-project-update-3/><p class="note title">Rover Project: Update 3</p><p class="note date">2021-07-04</p><p class="note content">Finally a more eventful update!
Last time I worked with building parts in CAD I was using solidworks or AutoCAD. I have no desire to buy either one of those right now plus I need something that will run on linux. So started investing some time into learning my way around FreeCAD.
Creating first iteration of the wheel 50mm radius for a 10cm/100mm diameter wheel
3mm thick
Based on the specs of the motor:<span class=mldr>&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class=tag href=/tags/rover-project/>rover-project</a></p></li><li class=item><a class=note href=/2021/07/04/rover-project-update-2/><p class="note title">Rover Project: Update 2</p><p class="note date">2021-07-04</p><p class="note content">So the robot parts sat in my closet for a few months. I kind of forgot to order the parts.
Recently realized I really need to disconnect more fully from work in my off hours. When your hobby includes coding and in same language as you write for work.. Its a bit harder to keep your brain from making that jump to thinking about work.
So i&rsquo;ve been on the look out for new hobbies.<span class=mldr>&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class=tag href=/tags/rover-project/>rover-project</a></p></li><li class=item><a class=note href=/2021/07/04/rover-project-update-1/><p class="note title">Rover Project: Update 1</p><p class="note date">2021-07-04</p><p class="note content">Parts came in!
Finally got time to work on it again. We wired everything up.
We gathered up some cardboard. We found something to trace and cut out 4 wheels. (you&rsquo;ll notice this is defintely a deviation from the original sketch. But this was insisted on once the additional motors were spotted).
We also put together the transmitter on another breadboard
Now if you do electronics seriously at all you&rsquo;ll probably notice straight away two different issues.<span class=mldr>&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class=tag href=/tags/rover-project/>rover-project</a></p></li><li class=item><a class=note href=/2021/07/04/rover-project/><p class="note title">Rover Project</p><p class="note date">2021-07-04</p><p class="note content">My family is very STEM oriented. I grew up learning hands on at home. Taking things apart. Questioning how things worked and eventually learning how to actually fix those things I took apart. As much as possible we&rsquo;re trying to encourage this for our kids.
They are pretty fortunate as they have good examples of this on both sides of the family. So they come by their curiousity about the world around them very naturally.<span class=mldr>&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class=tag href=/tags/rover-project/>rover-project</a></p></li><li class=item><a class=note href=/2020/09/07/ovh-serial-over-lan-sol/><p class="note title">OVH Serial over LAN (SOL)</p><p class="note date">2020-09-07</p><p class="note content">Its been a while since I&rsquo;ve worked with physical servers and typically when something happened I could pretty quickly get physical access to the box if things went pear shaped.
But when you buy or lease servers from a provider like OVH. Those servers might be sitting half way around the world. So if something goes wrong you need to some how virtually be in front of the keyboard.
OVH has a few different ways to access your servers console to interact with the machine directly.<span class=mldr>&mldr;</span></p></a></li></ul><div class=pagination><ul><li><a class=active href=/>1</a></li><li><a href=/page/2/>2</a></li><li><a href=/page/3/>3</a></li><li><a href=/page/4/>4</a></li></ul></div></section><section id=footer><div class=footer-wrap><p class=copyright>Aaron's Ramblings</p><p class=powerby><span>Powered by </span><a href=https://gohugo.io target=_blank>Hugo</a><span> and the </span><a href=https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-notepadium/ target=_blank>Notepadium</a></p></div></section></body></html>
