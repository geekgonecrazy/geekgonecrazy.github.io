            <p class="note title">Project Opacity: Prototype to Production</p><p class="note date">2011-02-03</p><p class="note content">About a month ago at work we started a project internally known as Project Opacity.
 Opacity by definition: isÂ the quality of being opaque to a degree; the degree to which something reduces the passage of light
 Anyways, on to what Project Opacity actually is. Through out the library there are computer stations from which patrons can access the library catalog. Which we call Opac&rsquo;s or kiosks. Come to think of it, this probably is where the name comes from.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/tags/hardware/">hardware</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/2011/01/04/destroying-a-hard-drive/">

So when I do get to I get slightly excited! Had an old pentium 3 desktop they planned to give away. But it their copy of xp on it as well as some somewhat sensitive information. At first we were going to put the linux distribution of our fancy on it(this changes from day to day). But it wouldn&rsquo;t boot from the cd.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/tags/hardware/">hardware</a><a class="tag" href="/tags/fun/">fun</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/2010/10/12/monitor-repair/">
            <p class="note title">Monitor Repair</p><p class="note date">2010-10-12</p><p class="note content">A few days ago I found a 22&rdquo; Lcd screen that was being tossed out because it didn&rsquo;t work. The thought of the beauty being thrown away didn&rsquo;t set well with me. So I picked it up.
Before messing with it.
When turning it on, it would show its gateway logo and then go blank. Which was a good sign. But none of the inputs worked.
So I took it apart.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/tags/hardware/">hardware</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/2010/03/24/building-first-desktop-from-scratch/">
            <p class="note title">Building first desktop from scratch</p><p class="note date">2010-03-24</p><p class="note content">Most of my childhood I have built computers. But it was always from parts laying around. A motherboard/CPU from here, case from another one etc.
I finally saved up and planned out my own build from scratch. I&rsquo;m posting to my blog because its a geeky milestone that every little geek must go through. A rite of passage if you will.
I ran into a couple of problems along the way.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="tag" href="/tags/hardware/">hardware</a></p></li></ul></section><section id="footer"><div class="footer-wrap">
