      <description>A while back I posted about Building first desktop from scratch. In it I mentioned installing Xenserver. I have no doubt that it is amazing. Just wasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly what I had in mind.
Long story cut extremely short, I went with virtualbox. Reasons being: Its fast, so far has supported everything I throw at it, stable, cross platform, live migration, snapshots make backup easy, easy to use, and I like it.</description>
