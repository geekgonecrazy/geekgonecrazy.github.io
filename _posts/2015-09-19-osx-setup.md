I've used Mac OSX a few times in my life.  But I decided to give it a serious go.  I've always loved the blend between unix and pretty.  I've always struggled with my linux desktop not being visually appealing enough.  Seems like the best of both worlds.

Writing this for my own future reference.  But hopefully someone else will find it useful.

<!--excerpt-->

## General OSX customization
I had to start out by making a few tweaks.

### Changed Scroll Direction
I'm using a normal mouse with a scroll wheel.  So the default feels very un-natural.

So I unchecked "Scroll direction: natural"

### Change Modifier keys
I'm using a Logitech keyboard not an apple keyboard.

This took a little figuring out to get right.  I mapped the windows key to the command key.

### Auto hide dock
I like the maximum amount of screen space I can get.  So of course I hide the dock.

### Hot Corner
I come from the world of Fedora running Gnome3.  So i'm very used to seeing everything with a quick flick of the mouse.

### Finder config
Couple of little tweaks I made.

I like having the hard drive icons on my desktop.  Its convenient.

Also like being able to quickly get to my home folder.

## Applications
Alright now to the good stuff.

I set to downloading applications.

### Google Chrome
Gotta have my favorite browser.

[Download Here](https://www.google.com/chrome)

### Spectacle
This is an application that allows you to use keyboard shortcuts to quickly snap windows.  Very useful

[Download Here](https://www.spectacleapp.com/)

### Atom
My favorite IDE.  I love the ability to use css / javascript to customize.  Plus it has tons of packages.  More on that another time.

[Download Here](https://atom.io)

### Virtualbox
Gotta have our vms!  This is useful for vagrant / docker / windows vms.

### Sequel Pro
Great tool for playing with SQL.

### Spotify
I bounce back between Spotify and Google Music.  If only Google Music had a great desktop app that would actually work.

### VLC
If a video / audio file won't play anywhere else.  This will play it.

[Download Here](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html)

### Brew
If you consider your self any sort of power user, this is a must.

## Terminal Setup

I spend a good portion of my time here.  So getting this looking good is important.

### Install theme

I use the solarized theme.

[Download Here](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized)

Once downloaded and extracted you have to install the color into your terminal. I installed Solarized Dark into iTerm2.

![iTerm2 Solarized](/images/2015-09-19/solarized-folder.png)

Double clicking will install it.

Next you go into iTerm preferences and add it to your profile.

I also took it a step further and added a little transparency.  Just a personal preference.

### Change shell
Next I changed my shell to zsh.  

```
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

### Install oh-my-zsh
I then installed oh-my-zsh.  This gives you access to different prompts.

[More Info Here](http://ohmyz.sh/)

```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

This will possibly prompt you to install XCode CLI tools.  If so do that.  Then re-run the command.

### Set prompt

To edit which one of the prompts you use do:

```
atom .zshrc
```

Replacing atom with your editor of choice.

Change the line near the top. That starts with `ZSH_THEME`

```
ZSH_THEME="ys"
```

I changed to `ys` which looks like this:

![ZSH Prompt](/images/2015-09-19/zsh-prompt.png)

Using `source ~/.zshrc` will reload your zsh config.

### Setup git Info
You'll be reminded at some point to do this.  But good to go ahead and set this.  :smile:

```
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

## Install misc other things
I used brew to install a few things I used frequently

```
brew install nodejs tmux ansible
```

Also I needed jekyll to write blog posts.  :smile:

```
gem install jekyll
```

## Summary
Great OS.  Lots of tools for developers.  If you have some program you can't live with out.  Would be glad to hear it.
