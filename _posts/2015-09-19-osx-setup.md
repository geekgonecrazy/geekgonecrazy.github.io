I'm an on again off again macOS / OSX user.  This started off at some point as a blog post, but its grown into more of a living page of the programs I install when on macOS / OSX.

<!--excerpt-->

## OS tweaks

### Changed Scroll Direction
If using a normal mouse with a scroll wheel.  The default "natural" feels very un-natural.

Unchecked "Scroll direction: natural"

### Change Modifier keys
If not using an apple keyboard.

Map the windows key to the command key.

### Auto hide dock
I like the maximum amount of screen space I can get.  So of course I hide the dock.

### Hot Corner
If i'm at a normal mouse and keyboard I like to turn this on.  Also if coming from Fedora/Gnome3 this helps feel more at home.

### Finder config
Very much personal preference.

I like having the hard drive icons on my desktop.  Its convenient.
![Finder Desktop](/images/2015-09-19/finder-desktop.png)

Also like being able to quickly get to my home folder.

### Screenshot Directory
I take a lot of screenshots.  So I don't want them cluttering my desktop.  So I change the folder they are saved to.

First create the directory you want them saved to.  I chose `~/Documents/Screenshots`

Then run this command:

```
defaults write com.apple.screencapture location ~/Documents/Screenshots
```

Then to reload so this takes its followed by:

```
killall SystemUIServer
```

For extra convenience I drag the folder into my dock so I have quick access to them.

## Applications
A few of the apps I always seem to download.

### Google Chrome
Gotta have my favorite browser.

[Download Here](https://www.google.com/chrome){:target="_blank"}

### Spectacle
This is an application that allows you to use keyboard shortcuts to quickly snap windows.  Very useful

[Download Here](https://www.spectacleapp.com/){:target="_blank"}

### Visual Studio Code
Code editor of choice.

![Vs Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/home/home-screenshot-mac.png)

Open the **Command Palette** (&#8679; + &#8984; + p)) and type 'shell command' to find the **Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH** command.

![vscode Commands](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/setup/mac/shell-command.png)

Also will need to set the git path.  The path if installed from xcode is: `/usr/bin/git`.  Simply typing git in the terminal will trigger a popup to install from xcode.

### Rocket.Chat
Awesome group chat platform like slack / hipchat.  Great set of developers.  This project is moving very quickly.

It for sure gets my recommendation for group chat in business.  Offers you that privacy and control that you want and need.

[Check the community out here](https://rocket.chat){:target="_blank"}
[Download Client Here](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.Electron/releases){:target="_blank"}

### Robo 3T (formally Robomongo)
Great application to query / view mongodb databases.

[Download Here](http://robomongo.org/){:target="_blank"}

### Google Play Music Desktop Player
Best desktop player for Google Music I've found

[Download Here](https://www.googleplaymusicdesktopplayer.com){:target="_blank"}

### VLC
If a video / audio file won't play anywhere else.  This will play it.

[Download Here](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html){:target="_blank"}

### iTerm2
Quickly becoming my favorite terminal emulator. This is what i'll use below for setting up my shell.

[Download Here](https://www.iterm2.com/){:target="_blank"}

### Hyper
I'm on again off again with this terminal.  One of the things I like most is cross-platform

[Download Here](https://hyper.is/){:target="_blank"}

### GifGrabber
Great application for recording gifs.

[Download Here](http://www.gifgrabber.com/){:target="_blank"}

### Docker for Mac
I use Docker a lot. :)

[Download Here](https://www.docker.com/docker-mac){:target="_blank"}

### Brew
If you consider your self any sort of power user, this is a must.

[Download Here](http://brew.sh/){:target="_blank"}

## Terminal


### zsh

I have come to like zsh.  So I always do this.

```
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

### Install oh-my-zsh
Part of what makes zsh awesome is installing oh-my-zsh.

[More Info Here](http://ohmyz.sh/){:target="_blank"}

```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

This will possibly prompt you to install XCode CLI tools.  If so do that.  Then re-run the command.

### Set zsh prompt

To edit which one of the prompts you use do:

```
code .zshrc
```

Replacing atom with your editor of choice.

Change the line near the top. That starts with `ZSH_THEME`

```
ZSH_THEME="ys"
```

I changed to `ys` which looks like this:

![ZSH Prompt](/images/2015-09-19/zsh-prompt.png)

Using `source ~/.zshrc` will reload your zsh config.

### Setup git Info
You'll be reminded at some point to do this.  But good to go ahead and set this.  :smile:

```
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

## Install misc other things
I used brew to install a few things I used frequently

```
brew install nodejs tmux golang gpg minio/stable/mc kubectl
```

Also I needed jekyll to write blog posts.  :smile:

```
gem install jekyll
```

## Summary
Great OS.  Lots of tools for developers.  If you have some program you can't live with out.  Would be glad to hear it.
