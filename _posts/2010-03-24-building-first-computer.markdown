Well after much waiting, I have officially built my first computer from scratch. Before this, any computer built was pieced together from parts laying around.  This
one was completely hand picked. 

<!--excerpt-->

Ran into some difficulties along the way.  A case/power supply combo I ordered online was a dud!  I sent it back and got a refund.  Future advice for anyone building
a computer.  Buy your power supply locally.  Its a lot easier to run back to
the store and exchange it then to buy it online and wait on shipping. 


I went to MicroCenter, one of my favorite computer stores in the Kansas City area.

Fans, tools, mobo/processor, 500w power supply, 4 gig ram, 500gig hard drive, new USB headset, Code red for energy and awesome green wig :D

Couple of pictures of the case.

The slots are for hot swappable hard drives.  I can pop a new drive in at any time with out having to power down.

I installed XenServer on it at first... But as awesome as it was... I like
having an operating system I can easily get around.  So I installed
Ubuntu 64bit 9.10. Btw... XFCE is a beautiful desktop environment.

Any questions or comments hit me up.
