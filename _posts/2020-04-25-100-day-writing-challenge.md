Hello its me again your friendly neighborhood Geek Gone Crazy.ðŸ˜œ Its been a bit less time since my last post than normal.  Recently I came across a challenge on mastodon to do a 100 day writing challenge. Inspired by the 100 days of code.

<!--excerpt-->

The idea being much like 100 days of code it encourages a person to sit down to write more often.  Of course by doing this you get better at it.

As you can see from my posting history here.. I don't post a lot.  But I do enjoy writing, I do a fair amount of writing for work and have always wanted to post a bit more. So.. here goes nothing!

Here's to hopefully a few more posts!
