I was assigned the task of creating a children's linux distro for use here at the library(where I work).  Here's a sneak peak:

<!--excerpt-->  

I'm basing it on Linux Mint for now.  I think i'll probably move it all over to straight Ubuntu before finalizing.  The dock is called docky.  Can be installed from apt-get.  

As you can see I've loaded it up with games.  Once i've finished i'll give a better break down of what i've done.

[edit 04/11/2014] It actually turned out looking nothing like this at all.  We called the project rachel. You can find out more about it on its [github page](https://github.com/geekgonecrazy/rachel).
