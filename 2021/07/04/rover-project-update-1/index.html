<img src=/images/2021-07-04/parts-2.jpg alt></p><p>Finally got time to work on it again. We wired everything up.</p><p><img src=/images/2021-07-04/parts-hookup-1.jpg alt></p><p>We gathered up some cardboard. We found something to trace and cut out 4 wheels. (you&rsquo;ll notice this is defintely a deviation from the original sketch. But this was insisted on once the additional motors were spotted).</p><p><img src=/images/2021-07-04/parts-hookup-2.jpg alt></p><p>We also put together the transmitter on another breadboard</p><p><img src=/images/2021-07-04/parts-hookup-3.jpg alt></p><p>Now if you do electronics seriously at all you&rsquo;ll probably notice straight away two different issues. I was tempted to omit it and just have the build log with final parts.. But this is part of the journey. I think it was important for kids to go through as well. Not everything works first time around. In fact probably doesn&rsquo;t most of the time.</p><p>Issue 1: Those are stepper motors and drivers. ðŸ™ˆ Yeah.. I don&rsquo;t even know how I did that. I did place the order late.. but I even have some articles stashed away specifically for working with those drivers. So its not like I didn&rsquo;t research the parts. We&rsquo;ll chock it up to lesson learned though.</p><p>Issue 2: Those 433Mhz Transmitter / Receivers don&rsquo;t have even their basic included antenna&rsquo;s soldered on. Reading later.. with out an antenna range is like a few centemeters.</p><p>Needless to say we discovered both of these issues after several hours. I pretty quickly wrote up the arduino code for both. I wrote the code that would send a simple signal that would include a signal for both the left and the right side tank style.</p><p>My Plan was:</p><ul><li>Forward: 01 FF 01FF</li><li>Backward: 02 FF 02 FF</li><li>Forward Left: 01 FF 01 99</li><li>Forward Right: 01 99 01 FF</li></ul><p>Pattern being: {Left Motor Polarity} {Left Motor Speed} {Right Motor Polarity} {Right Motor Speed}</p><p>With the speed being 0-255 represented in hex. No CRC or anything at first.</p><p>This didn&rsquo;t work.</p><p>So figured maybe I was being too clever and switch to transmitting strings and probably 10x variations.</p><p>So after still not even a hum from the motors.. I figured it must be just something wrong with the 433Mhz pair. I wanted to at least validate the motors worked. So I found an example program for those motors show them working. It was here and getting this to work&mldr; I realized these aren&rsquo;t really the right motors for the wheels.</p><p>So we shelved it until I could go and order the right motors.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t until later I actually realized I some how completely spazzed on putting antenna&rsquo;s on and their range was only centimeters with out one.</p></article><section class="article labels"><a class=tag href=/tags/rover-project/>rover-project</a></section></div><div class="article bottom"><section class="article navigation"><p><a class=link href=/2021/07/04/rover-project-update-2/><span class="iconfont icon-article"></span>Rover Project: Update 2</a></p><p><a class=link href=/2021/07/04/rover-project/><span class="iconfont icon-article"></span>Rover Project</a></p></section></div></section><section id=footer><div class=footer-wrap><p class=copyright>Aaron's Ramblings</p><p class=powerby><span>Powered by </span><a href=https://gohugo.io target=_blank>Hugo</a><span> and the </span><a href=https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-notepadium/ target=_blank>Notepadium</a></p></div></section></body></html>
