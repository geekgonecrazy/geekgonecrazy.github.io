A quick search around the web will return many results of people doing this. My reasons are likely similar to many others. Privacy being the most common shared reason.</p><p>Ok that&rsquo;s it I spoiled it! Now you don&rsquo;t need to read on ðŸ˜œ But I&rsquo;ll explain anyways.</p><h1 id=privacy>Privacy</h1><p>Google gives their applications and services away for free. This is extreeemly attractive! We humans are cheap! That&rsquo;s not totally fair.. But I think in regard to software it holds true.</p><p>We will buy the best hardware in the world and then we hunt for the cheapest software we can find. But this is a rabbit hole.. I won&rsquo;t go down today.</p><p>What we often forget(my self included) is to stop and ask your self a question:</p><blockquote><p>How are they able to pay people to make this if they are giving it away for free?</p></blockquote><p>Don&rsquo;t know? Let me help you out. You are paying with your data!</p><p>Of course there are exceptions that I won&rsquo;t go into here. But for the most part this holds true.</p><p>Google specifically is an ad company. This is how they make money. &ldquo;But I thought Google was just a search engine?&rdquo; Nope they historically make most money on ads. <a href=https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/020515/business-google.asp target=_blank>Here is one example</a> of many out there talking about this. So your data feeds their ad machine.</p><p>Creeped out yet? Me too..</p><h1 id=google-grave-yard>Google Grave yard</h1><p>A less common reason.. I&rsquo;ll try not to sound too bitter here. Bear with me. But Google has left in its wake a trail of bodies.</p><p>A few that I used to use:</p><ul><li>Google Wave - so cool</li><li>Google Reader - still don&rsquo;t have one I like as much</li><li>100 different messaging products - I&rsquo;m exaggeratingâ€¦ but only slightly</li><li>Many more</li></ul><p>Its enough that there is a dedicated website just to products Google has killed:</p><p><a href=https://killedbygoogle.com>https://killedbygoogle.com</a></p><p>If they can&rsquo;t figure out how to get their ad clicks or get bored (seems to be the case of messengers) to the chopping block they go!</p><h1 id=diversity>Diversity</h1><p>It goes a bit beyond Google for me. Its more like a way of life. As the old saying goes:</p><blockquote><p>Dont put all of your eggs in one basket</p></blockquote><p>What if a company went out of business and took all of your data with them? This has happened.</p><p>Diversifying the companies you use for services you can&rsquo;t host your self is like hedging your bets.</p><hr><p>Thats it folks! Hopefully my perspective is different enough to be interesting. ðŸ˜œ I might follow this up with how I have de-googled.</p></article><section class="article labels"><a class=tag href=/tags/100daystooffload/>100DaysToOffload</a></section></div><div class="article bottom"><section class="article navigation"><p><a class=link href=/2020/04/28/de-googling-my-progress/><span class="iconfont icon-article"></span>De-Googling: My Progress</a></p><p><a class=link href=/2020/04/26/hacking-in-the-physical-world/><span class="iconfont icon-article"></span>Hacking in the Physical World</a></p></section></div></section><section id=footer><div class=footer-wrap><p class=copyright>Aaron's Ramblings</p><p class=powerby><span>Powered by </span><a href=https://gohugo.io target=_blank>Hugo</a><span> and the </span><a href=https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-notepadium/ target=_blank>Notepadium</a></p></div></section></body></html>
