This exercise was revealing. It was often a great way to see how much we’d achieved that you might lose sight of in the daily grind. This year, I decided to apply the same reflection to my personal life.</p><p>Here’s a TL;DR of 2024:</p><h2 id=personal-life>Personal Life</h2><ul><li><a href=#a-year-free-from-caffeine>A Year Free From Caffeine</a></li><li>Returned to <a href=#martial-arts>Martial Arts</a></li><li>Increased focus on <a href=#working-out>Working Out</a></li><li>Lost <a href=#impact>12 pounds</a></li><li>Traveled to Brazil and London</li></ul><h2 id=professionally>Professionally</h2><ul><li>Emphasized <a href=#production-readiness>Production Readiness</a></li><li>Grew as a <a href=#staff-engineer>Staff Engineer</a></li><li><a href=#new-job>Changed jobs</a> after nearly a decade</li><li>Explored <a href=#technology>New Technology</a></li><li>Adopted a <a href=#daily-tech-stack>Streamlined Tech Setup</a></li></ul><hr><h1 id=personal-life-1>Personal Life</h1><p>2024 was full of ups and downs, but I made meaningful progress in key areas.</p><h2 id=health>Health</h2><p>Improving my health became a major focus—not due to serious issues, but because I realized it’s easier to maintain health now than to regain it later.</p><h3 id=a-year-free-from-caffeine>A Year Free From Caffeine</h3><p>In October 2023, I noticed I couldn’t function without caffeine. Specifically, Dr. Pepper. Running out at home meant struggling through the day. It felt like an addiction, so I quit.</p><p>As of October 2024, I’ve gone an entire year without caffeinated soda. However, I replaced it with sugary alternatives, which wasn’t much healthier. In recent months, I’ve started cutting back on soda altogether to reduce my sugar intake.</p><h3 id=martial-arts>Martial Arts</h3><p>Martial arts have always been a passion. I earned a yellow belt in Karate during college but stopped due to cost. This year, I joined my kids in their Karate classes. I’ve regained my yellow belt and plan to continue. It’s a great way to disconnect and blow off steam.</p><h3 id=working-out>Working Out</h3><p>I’ve been gradually building a home gym and increasing my exercise routine. My goal is to expand this habit in 2025.</p><h3 id=impact>Impact</h3><p>These efforts have paid off. I’ve lost 12 pounds in four months and feel much better overall. I can even spar without feeling like I’m going to pass out!</p><hr><h2 id=travel>Travel</h2><p>I traveled internationally twice this year:</p><ul><li><strong>Brazil</strong>: A work trip brought me to Porto Alegre just a week before the airport was severely flooded.</li><li><strong>London</strong>: I took my family on a trip to London. The kids first trip overseas, which was an unforgettable experience for us all.</li></ul><hr><h1 id=work--professional>Work / Professional</h1><p>2024 brought significant changes to my career.</p><h2 id=production-readiness>Production Readiness</h2><p>In the year’s first half, I focused on production readiness: defining SLAs/SLOs, identifying critical user experience factors, and identifying risks. This involved formalizing processes, exposing key metrics and making architectural changes.</p><h2 id=staff-engineer>Staff Engineer</h2><p>At Rocket.Chat, I held various roles. Engineering Manager, Tech Lead, Team Lead, and more. This year, I tried to embrace being a Staff Engineer, focusing on coding, dev ex, writing, mentoring, and cross-team alignment. I’ve found this balance fulfilling. Even more so in retrospect.</p><h2 id=new-job>New Job</h2><p>After nearly 10 years at Rocket.Chat, I transitioned to a new role as a Senior Software Engineer at a new company building fiber networks in communities and the software required to provide a marketplace for the members of those communties to chose their ISP and have their equipment provisioned. This change was important to allow me to reset and perform a rebalance of work/life. But also a good opportunity to learn something new, particularly in the ISP space which i&rsquo;ve always found interesting.</p><p>Some times a change is required to help us realize what we value. I realize I find fulfillment in participating in architecture and direction, not just coding. This is something I&rsquo;ll be focusing on in the new year.</p><hr><h2 id=technology>Technology</h2><p>Joining a new team meant working with new technologies:</p><ul><li><strong>Microservices</strong>: I&rsquo;ve worked with microservices before typically by breaking part of a monolith off to enable more dynamic scaling. I&rsquo;ve never worked with a microservice first architecture. While microservices can enable scaling and team parallelism, the complexity isn’t always worth it for smaller teams.</li><li><strong>GraphQL</strong>: Although I see its appeal, GraphQL introduces challenges with network traffic, authorization, and increased boilerplate code necessary. I still prefer well-crafted RESTful APIs.</li><li><strong>gRPC and Protobufs</strong>: Defining services with Protobufs and generating REST APIs, openapi documentation, and gRPC Gateway code is really cool. I plan to explore this more.</li></ul><p>This article by tailscale is a good read that has been top of mind: <a href=https://tailscale.com/blog/new-internet target=_blank>https://tailscale.com/blog/new-internet</a></p><hr><h2 id=daily-tech-stack>Daily Tech Stack</h2><p>This year, I used:</p><ul><li><a href=https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/silverblue/ target=_blank>Silverblue</a>, an immutable OSTree OS,</li><li>A custom OSTree branch, <a href=https://github.com/geekgonecrazy/triiodide target=_blank>Triiodide</a> (i3 - 3 iodine atoms is a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triiodide target=_blank>triiodide</a> ion) that brings i3wm instead of gnome</li><li><a href=https://ghostty.org target=_blank>Ghostty</a> for a performant terminal experience</li><li>A single 32&rdquo; curved monitor plus a smaller secondary display for chat, video conferencing and music</li></ul><hr><h1 id=2025>2025</h1><p>I don&rsquo;t really do new year&rsquo;s resolutions any more.
