I found the research and reflection while writing the post to be very revealing. We some times get so caught up in the daily grind, we aren&rsquo;t able to see what we&rsquo;ve managed to accomplish. This year going to give it a try applying it to my personal life.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s a TL;DR of the year:</p><p><strong>Personal Life</strong></p><ul><li><a href=#a-year-free-from-caffiene>A year free from Caffiene</a></li><li>Started back into <a href=#martial-arts>Martial Arts</a></li><li>Started <a href=#working-out>Working Out</a> more</li><li>Lost <a href=#impact>12 pounds</a></li><li>Traveled to Brazil and London</li><li>Experienced some culture with Hamilton and Star Wars at the Houston Symphony</li></ul><p><strong>Professionally</strong></p><ul><li>Focused on <a href=#production-readiness>Production Readiness</a></li><li>Focused on being a better <a href=#staff-engineer>Staff Engineer</a></li><li><a href=#new-job>Changed jobs</a> after almost 10 years at the same company</li><li>Got to be hands on with some <a href=#technology>new technology</a></li><li>Stuck with <a href=#daily-tech-stack>single desktop setup</a> for most of the year</li></ul><h1 id=personal-life>Personal Life</h1><p>As with any year.. Full of ups and downs. But overall I feel like I made some good progress in a few areas.</p><h2 id=health>Health</h2><p>Improving my health has been a big focus for me this year. Thankfully this isn&rsquo;t because i&rsquo;ve started having any serious problems. But I have come to realize its only going to get harder to get healthly the older I get.</p><h3 id=a-year-free-from-caffiene>A Year Free From Caffiene</h3><p>Back in October of 2023. I came to realization that I could not function without caffeine. Dr. Pepper to be precise. If we ran out in the house and I had a busy day and was unable to go get more.. I would suffer the whole day. This felt like addiction to me.</p><p>I made the decision to cut it completely and haven&rsquo;t had a Dr. Pepper or any other caffinated soda since then. As of October this year that was a whole year without it.</p><p>The downside is I replaced that with other sodas that were high in sugar. So while I was free from caffiene.. I wasn&rsquo;t really seeing any health benefits from this change.</p><p>A few months ago I started conciously drinking less soda and focus on reducing the sugar intake.</p><h3 id=martial-arts>Martial Arts</h3><p>I&rsquo;ve always been a big fan of Martial Arts. Even earned my Yellow Belt in Karate back in college. But stopped at the time because I was a cheap college kid that couldn&rsquo;t at the time justify the cost of class.</p><p>My kids have all been in Karate all year. Decided to join them. So i&rsquo;m back up to yellow belt and intend to carry on as its become a great way to blow off steam and disconnect.</p><h3 id=working-out>Working out</h3><p>I&rsquo;ve slowly been building out a home gym and regularly doing extra exercise. I hope to continue to increase this into 2025.</p><h3 id=impact>Impact</h3><p>I feel a lot better. I&rsquo;ve lost 12 pounds since I started this journey only 4 months ago.</p><p>I can now spar without feeling like i&rsquo;m going to pass out.</p><h2 id=travel>Travel</h2><p>Took a work trip to Brazil. Crazy thing is I went through the airport in Port Alegre only a week before the <a href=https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/08/weather/brazil-flooding-satellite-imagery-intl/index.html target=_blank>entire airport was flooded</a>.</p><p>Took my wife and kids to London. This was my kids first time out of country.</p><h2 id=culture>Culture</h2><p>I&rsquo;ve been trying experience a bit of &ldquo;culture&rdquo; in recent years.</p><p>I saw <a href=https://hamiltonmusical.com target=_blank>Hamilton</a> performed in London this year. It was a lot more moving in person. Also I don&rsquo;t get why its so much cheaper to see plays in London than anywhere here in the US&mldr;</p><p>I also got to experience <a href=https://houstonsymphony.org/tickets/concerts/the-music-of-star-wars/ target=_blank>Star Wars at the Houston Symphony</a> this year. I&rsquo;d recommend.</p><h1 id=work--professional>Work / Professional</h1><p>2024 involved a rather big change for my professionally.</p><h2 id=production-readiness>Production Readiness</h2><p>This is something I spent a good bit of time on during the first part of the year. Taking existing services and focusing on establishing SLA/SLOs. Identifying what is important for the user experience. Then working backwards to identify what risks making delivering this possible.</p><p>While not the first time thinking about this. It was really a time of formalizing things and making architectural changes in order to make it happen.</p><h2 id=staff-engineer>Staff Engineer</h2><p>Over the course of my career at Rocket.Chat i&rsquo;ve held a number of roles. Everything from just core contributor, to Engineering Manager, to Tech Lead, to Team Lead and a bunch of things in between.</p><p>This year I spent some time trying to settle into the role of Staff Engineer / Architect with out any of the management components.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve found that I really like the role of staff engineer. Its a good mixture of coding, writing, leading (not managing), mentoring and helping aligning across teams.</p><h2 id=new-job>New Job</h2><p>One of the biggest changes for me this year was changing jobs. I had been at Rocket.Chat for almost 10 years. The original team I built spun off into 3 seperate teams. The downside to this is I still was heavily involved in all 3 of them. In retrospect I was acting a bit like a director setting roadmaps and direction of the teams, while being inside one of the teams, and being a Staff Engineer / Architect. My work/life balance was off and I was struggling to reset it. Even though I&rsquo;d take time off.. I was unable to fully disconnect.</p><p>I got a job offer to be a Senior Engineer at a company called Underline who is building fiber networks in communities and all of the software it takes to make that happen. I&rsquo;ve always been interested in global infrastructure and how they are built and operate. So I took the job as a chance to shake things up, reset and learn something new. Part of me was also curious what it would be like to be just a software engineer again.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve quickly come to realize that i&rsquo;m not ok just being a software engineer. I don&rsquo;t enjoy just taking other peoples plans and ideas and just executing them. I enjoy being involved in the architecture and direction of the software. I&rsquo;m not sure if this is just because i&rsquo;m used to it or if its just how I am wired.</p><h3 id=technology>Technology</h3><p>Part of the new job means working with some new technology.</p><h4 id=microservices>Microservices</h4><p>I had previously worked with microservices. But typically only in the context of breaking off a piece of a monolith in order to enable scale. Never in a microservice first architecture.</p><p>The downside of microservices is the complexity they bring. I can imagine very large teams microservices could potentially enable not just scale in the load, but also allow multiple teams to work on different parts of a system in parallel.</p><p>In a small team and when scale for load isn&rsquo;t needed.. i&rsquo;m still not convinced its the right choice. But i&rsquo;m open to being convinced.</p><h4 id=graphql>Graphql</h4><p>I had previously tried graphql. Mostly consuming it. It always seemed like the idea was cool. That you could make less api calls and get all of the information you needed.</p><p>In practice&mldr; I don&rsquo;t think it really reduces the number of api calls. It also means more calls bouncing around inside the network to get the data. Making authorization harder cause you&rsquo;ve got to make sure the user is authorized to fetch each piece of information instead of just authorized to make the call.</p><p>Also it leads to a lot of boilerplate code. I still prefer a RESTful api.</p><h4 id=grpc-and-grpc-gateway>GRPC and GRPC Gateway</h4><p>I&rsquo;ve watched and read about GRPC and Protobufs for a while. But never had a good reason to use them.</p><p>Being able to define a protobuf service and from that generate the types as well as a full swagger documentation for a rest api and grpc-gateway code is pretty cool.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll definitely be playing with this more in the future.</p><h1 id=daily-tech-stack>Daily Tech Stack</h1><p>For all of 2024 i&rsquo;ve used Silverblue. An Ostree/Immutable Operating system. All desktop apps are installed via flatpaks. Other programs are layered on top, or installed in a dev container. I&rsquo;ve got a custom ostree branch called <a href=https://github.com/geekgonecrazy/triiodide target=_blank>Triiodide</a> (triiodide is 3 iodine atoms - i).</p><p>i3wm is still my window manager of choice. Having applications assigned to certain workspaces and certain workspaces assigned to certain monitors is the optimization i&rsquo;ve made this year.</p><p>Some day i&rsquo;ll make a post about this.</p><p>A new addition is <a href=https://ghostty.org target=_blank>Ghostty</a>. Previously I used alacritty. Nothing wrong with it. But i&rsquo;m a fan of the creator of Ghostty and I like the focus on performance and simplicity.</p><p>Also spent the year with a Single 32&rdquo; Curved Monitor with a secondary small dedicated monitor for chat, music and video calls.</p><p>I really like this simple setup.</p><h1 id=2025>2025</h1><p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to 2025. I plan to continue to focus on my health. I also hope to get back to writing more as well as back to doing more Staff Engineer / Architect type work.</p></article></div><div class="article bottom"><section class="article navigation"><p><a class=link href=/2023/09/24/fedora-iot-greenboot-systemd-and-of-course-dns/><span class="iconfont icon-article"></span>Fedora Iot, Greenboot, Systemd and of course DNS</a></p></section></div></section><section id=footer><div class=footer-wrap><p class=copyright>Aaron's Ramblings</p><p class=powerby><span>Powered by </span><a href=https://gohugo.io target=_blank>Hugo</a><span> and the </span><a href=https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-notepadium/ target=_blank>Notepadium</a></p></div></section></body></html>
