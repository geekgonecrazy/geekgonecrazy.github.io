My name is Aaron.  I started programming when I was 10 years old when my dad taught me GW-Basic on an old IBM pc.  I've been hooked ever since.  I love learning new languages.  I consider my self a full stack developer.  I enjoy working with every piece of the stack.  My current passion is devops / chatops.
