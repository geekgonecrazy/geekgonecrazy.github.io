# 2024 is now in the books!

In previous years, I wrote internal posts at work to reflect on the year and highlight accomplishments. This exercise was revealing.  It was often a great way to see how much we’d achieved that you might lose sight of in the daily grind. This year, I decided to apply the same reflection to my personal life.

Here’s a TL;DR of 2024:

## Personal Life
- [A Year Free From Caffeine](#a-year-free-from-caffeine)
- Returned to [Martial Arts](#martial-arts)
- Increased focus on [Working Out](#working-out)
- Lost [12 pounds](#impact)
- Traveled to Brazil and London

## Professionally
- Emphasized [Production Readiness](#production-readiness)
- Grew as a [Staff Engineer](#staff-engineer)
- [Changed jobs](#new-job) after nearly a decade
- Explored [New Technology](#technology)
- Adopted a [Streamlined Tech Setup](#daily-tech-stack)

# Personal Life

2024 was full of ups and downs, but I made meaningful progress in key areas.

## Health

Improving my health became a major focus—not due to serious issues, but because I realized it’s easier to maintain health now than to regain it later.

### A Year Free From Caffeine
In October 2023, I noticed I couldn’t function without caffeine. Specifically, Dr. Pepper. Running out at home meant struggling through the day. It felt like an addiction, so I quit.

As of October 2024, I’ve gone an entire year without caffeinated soda. However, I replaced it with sugary alternatives, which wasn’t much healthier. In recent months, I’ve started cutting back on soda altogether to reduce my sugar intake.

### Martial Arts
Martial arts have always been a passion. I earned a yellow belt in Karate during college but stopped due to cost. This year, I joined my kids in their Karate classes. I’ve regained my yellow belt and plan to continue. It’s a great way to disconnect and blow off steam.

### Working Out
I’ve been gradually building a home gym and increasing my exercise routine. My goal is to expand this habit in 2025.

### Impact
These efforts have paid off. I’ve lost 12 pounds in four months and feel much better overall. I can even spar without feeling like I’m going to pass out!

## Travel

I traveled internationally twice this year:
- **Brazil**: A work trip brought me to Porto Alegre just a week before the airport was severely flooded.
- **London**: I took my family on a trip to London. The kids first trip overseas, which was an unforgettable experience for us all.

# Work / Professional

2024 brought significant changes to my career.

## Production Readiness
In the year’s first half, I focused on production readiness: defining SLAs/SLOs, identifying critical user experience factors, and identifying risks. This involved formalizing processes, exposing key metrics and making architectural changes.

## Staff Engineer
At Rocket.Chat, I held various roles. Engineering Manager, Tech Lead, Team Lead, and more. This year, I tried to embrace being a Staff Engineer, focusing on coding, dev ex, writing, mentoring, and cross-team alignment. I’ve found this balance fulfilling.  Even more so in retrospect.

## New Job
After nearly 10 years at Rocket.Chat, I transitioned to a new role as a Senior Software Engineer at a new company building fiber networks in communities and the software required to provide a marketplace for the members of those communties to chose their ISP and have their equipment provisioned. This change was important to allow me to reset and perform a rebalance of work/life. But also a good opportunity to learn something new, particularly in the ISP space which i've always found interesting.

Some times a change is required to help us realize what we value.  I realize I find fulfillment in participating in architecture and direction, not just coding. This is something I'll be focusing on in the new year.

## Technology

Joining a new team meant working with new technologies:

- **Microservices**: I've worked with microservices before typically by breaking part of a monolith off to enable more dynamic scaling.  I've never worked with a microservice first architecture.  While microservices can enable scaling and team parallelism, the complexity isn’t always worth it for smaller teams.
- **GraphQL**: Although I see its appeal, GraphQL introduces challenges with network traffic, authorization, and increased boilerplate code necessary. I still prefer well-crafted RESTful APIs.
- **gRPC and Protobufs**: Defining services with Protobufs and generating REST APIs, openapi documentation, and gRPC Gateway code is really cool. I plan to explore this more.

## Daily Tech Stack

This year, I used:
- [Silverblue](https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/silverblue/), an immutable OSTree OS,
- A custom OSTree branch, [Triiodide](https://github.com/geekgonecrazy/triiodide) (i3 - 3 iodine atoms is a [triiodide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triiodide) ion) that brings i3wm instead of gnome
- [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org) for a performant terminal experience
- A single 32" curved monitor plus a smaller secondary display for chat, video conferencing and music

# 2025

I don't really do new year's resolutions any more. You don't need to wait for a new year to make a change.

But, I do plan to continue to focus on health, doing more writing, and focus on work I find fullfilling.

Here’s to another year of growth!
